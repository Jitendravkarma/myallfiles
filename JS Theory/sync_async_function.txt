Synchronous or Blocking function and Asynchronous or Non-blocking function :- Function classification on the basis of its working style 

-> Synchronous or Blocking function : Those function which on execution will restrict further code from execution , untill its self execution gets completed are synchronous or blocking function.

-> Asynchronous or Non-Blocking function : Those function which on execution will not restrict further code from execution are asynchronous or non-blocking function.

Note : * All function are by default synchronous in nature , to deploy them asynchronously additional feature is to be added

* Maximum times callback are implemented asynchronous in nature
